=== Parameters (Configuration Settings) ===

M_WIDTH           = Memory Width
                    (Appears unused in code - likely legacy/reserved parameter)

M_STACK           = Memory Stack Size
                    Number of byte locations in RAM (array size: 0 to M_STACK-1)

DATA_W            = Data Width
                    Bit-width of data bus (typically 32 for 32-bit systems)

PC_WIDTH          = Program Counter Width
                    Bit-width of addresses (determines max addressable memory)

STORE_M           = Store Mode Width
                    Bit-width for mode signal (2 bits to encode 3 store types)

ADDR_WIDTH        = Address Width
                    Bit-width of each memory cell (typically 8 bits = 1 byte)

DATA_INIT_FILE    = Data Initialization File
                    Filename string for pre-loading RAM contents at startup


=== Input Ports (Signals Coming In) ===

clk               = Clock
                    Timing signal - triggers write operations on rising edge

n_rst             = Negative Reset
                    Reset signal (active low) - currently unused in code

wr_en             = Write Enable
                    Control flag: 1=allow writes, 0=block writes

rd_addr           = Read Address
                    Memory location to read from (byte address)

wr_addr           = Write Address
                    Memory location to write to (byte address)

mode              = Store Mode
                    Specifies write granularity (byte/half-word/word)

d_in              = Data Input
                    Data value to be written into memory


=== Output Ports (Signals Going Out) ===

d_out             = Data Output
                    32-bit data read from memory (4 consecutive bytes)


=== Local Constants (Internal Definitions) ===

ST_B              = Store Byte
                    Mode code (2'b00) for writing 1 byte

ST_H              = Store Half-word
                    Mode code (2'b01) for writing 2 bytes (16 bits)

ST_W              = Store Word
                    Mode code (2'b10) for writing 4 bytes (32 bits)


=== Internal Variables (Storage) ===

ram               = Random Access Memory
                    2D array storing all memory contents (byte-addressable)

=== My addings ===

2b'01

reg is register but not hardware part. But, a data type(a variable that holds a value)

memo

Memory is typeless - programs track types!:
The CPU gets all 4 bytes but must know: "I only stored 1 byte here, so I'll only use the lowest byte (0xEF) and ignore the rest."
