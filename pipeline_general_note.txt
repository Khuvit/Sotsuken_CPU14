structural hazard:
1 memory with 1 read/port cannot handle cannot handle Memory access and Memory fetch at the same time, so more like structural/design hazard
(SO we delay 3rd instru 1 cycle)

Data hazard:

intsru Decode cycle wants to read reg value, but previous instru handling that reg value cannot be update at the time. So read the old value.
so we use bypassing or forwarding So the pipeline register(urt nariin box) can send the value using special data path to next instru ALU.
